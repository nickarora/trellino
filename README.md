## Description
Trellino is a clone of popular web-based project management software, Trello. 

In Trellino, projects are represented by boards, which contain lists (corresponding to task lists). Lists contain cards (corresponding to tasks). 

Cards can be freely moved from one list to the next (via drag-and-drop) --  mirroring the flow of a feature from idea to implementation.  

Each individual card, contains a unique description and a checklist -- which can be accessed by clicking on the card.
